# MBPP datasets
Here is our test dataset MBPP, which includes the original MBPP test dataset (Python) and our manually translated datasets (C++, Java, JavaScript). Each programming language contains a total of 500 entries, with an average of 3 test cases per entry. 

**Note:** We generate the transformed code snippets online(before feed input into LLMs), so there are the origin datasets, not the transformed datasets.
