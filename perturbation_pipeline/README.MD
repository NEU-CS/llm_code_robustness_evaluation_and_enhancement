# Perturbation_pipeline
## we use functions in pipeline.py to transform code snippets
Different transformations have different application conditions: for example, renaming a identifier requires the presence of a variable in a piece of code (which most code satisfies), while converting a for loop to a while loop requires the presence of a for loop in the code (fewer pieces of code may satisfy this).
